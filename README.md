## File structure üìÇ

The file structure follows the pattern:

```
| - src
|  | - components
|  |  | - sidebar
|  |  | - chat-input
|  |  | - spinner
|  |  | - nav
|  |  | - chat-output
|  | - pages
|  |  | - dashboard
|  |  | - 404
```

- `components` contains all the app components that are reused throghout the entire application.
- `pages` contains the entire app routing system, with the following structure:

```
| - dashboard
|  | - index.tsx //corresponds to /dashboard
|  | - settings
|  |  | - index.tsx //corresponds to /dashboard/settings

```

### Utilities üß∞

The `src/utils` folder contains some utility files:

- api.ts: all API calls are listed here
- helpers.ts: some general-purpose functions
- session.ts: handles the user session management
- tracking.ts: contains some Mixpanel functions
- icons.json: lists all icons downloaded from Icomoon

## Global state üåç

The app's global state is handled through [recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).
Every component handles its own state in its _atom.ts_ file.

## Environmental variables

The app uses two kinds of environmental variables:

- **public**: listed in the _.env_ file
- **private**: not commited to the GitLab repo and listed in a _.env.local_ file, which is in the .gitignore file.

The environmental variables used throughout the app are defined in `src/vite-env.d.ts`. Any new variable must be defined here to have autocompletion for `import.meta.env` in the IDE.

## Development üíª

### Start the server

To start the development, clone this repository.

After cloning it, create a local environment configuration file `.env` with the following keys:

```
VITE_CHATBOT_API_BASEPATH=
VITE_IMPACT_API_BASEPATH=
VITE_DOC_API_BASEPATH=
VITE_MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN=
```

Then, create a local environment configuration file `.env.local` with the following keys:

```
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENTID=
VITE_API_KEY=
VITE_SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
```

Ask your favourite developer for the keys.
Afterwards, run:

```bash
cd frontend-app
yarn install
yarn dev
```
